If you are on a windows machine, the program `rail.exe` is a compiled
version of the interpreter. Just run it without any arguments to get
the usage description. If you want to compile it yourself, open
`rail.sln` with Visual Studio.

If you are on a *nix machine, type `sh compile.sh` to compile. This
will create a program called `rail`. Run it to get usage. It is
assumed that you have g++.

There are a number of simple example programs provided which exercise
various parts of the language.

To see a description of the language, go to:

Hope you have fun with this. I certainly did when I made it.
